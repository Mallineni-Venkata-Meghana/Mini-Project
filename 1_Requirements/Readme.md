# Railway Reservation System - (RRS)

# Introduction:-

## What is RRS?
In this project we are going to implement sorting of train numbers using bubble sort algorithm, train names using selection sort,names of passengers 
in the train using insertion sort,PNR using Quick sort . Prepare a collection to store atleast 50 numbers, 50 train names. Here we are going to use 
an array to store the elements. In the array all the elements can be stored in linear passion. We will append elements to an array by using a function.
After adding all the elements to array, we will sort it by using bubble sort. Bubble sort is simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping 
the adjacent elements if they are not sorted. 


## Objectives Of Project:-

  1) This project aims to simplify the task of maintaining records Passengers.
  2) To develop an well-designed database to store Passenger information.
  3) Provides full functional reports to management.
  4) The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive approach towards the Railway Reservation System.
